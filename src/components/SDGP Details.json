  "ProjectDescription": "This project introduces Claim Ease, a modern system aiming to improve the vehicle insurance claiming process in Sri Lanka by eliminating manual inspections, reducing waiting times, and delays in claims processing by implementing image recognition technology for damage assessment. The existing process needs to be improved, causing delays, customer dissatisfaction, and traffic congestion at accident sites.  The proposed solution is expected to establish a new standard of efficiency and trust in the Sri Lankan insurance industry. Claim Ease, a user-friendly mobile application, uses advanced image recognition to assess damages, removing the need for on-site inspections by insurance agents. Users are able to receive instant cost estimates,  and can independently initiate claims. This solution aims to enhance efficiency, empower users to swiftly capture damage details, and establish a new standard of trust in the Sri Lankan insurance industry. In addition, an SVM is used for image classification, mapping severity classes to repair costs and a predictive model trained on insurance claims data estimates claim amounts. The system is intended to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the vehicle damage assessment process, resulting in a more informed and effective insurance claim procedure. Features of the solution include advanced image recognition, a self-claiming process, real-time cost estimation, and fraud detection. Users capture real-time images of their damaged vehicles for damage estimation and number plates for verification, ensuring a seamless process. By catering to the needs of vehicle owners and insurance companies. Claim Ease paves the way for a future where the insurance claiming experience is marked by transparency, speed, and reliability, setting a benchmark for excellence in the Sri Lankan insurance sector.\n",

There are withering, rolling, fermentation, Fermentation, Drying, and Sorting. This traditional method is known for producing high-quality teas with complex flavors and aromas. However, it is also a relatively slow and labor-intensive process, making it more expensive than the other methods such as CTC (cut, tear, and curl). Despite this, many Sri Lankan tea producers remain committed to the orthodox method, believing it results in superior tea.(Manufacturing. Sri Lanka Tea Board 2020)",

  "ProjectTitle": "ChromaCraft",
  "ProjectDescription": "ChromaCraft is a single app that unifies the theming of any app and provides a way to generate themes on the fly. You are originally provided with a GUI front-end, to select a system-wide colour palette. Then, you are asked to select the theme templates you want to generate, and the location you want to generate it to (Usually %APPDATA% on Windows, and ~\/.config on Unix-like OSes). This can be set up in a way that all the themes are updated when you change the colour palette and hit generate. In addition, the app also provides fine-grained control over the colour choices. The options are in separate conceptual levels, the first is,\n1. System-wide colour palette\n\na. Semantic colours\n\nThese are options that contain meaning with regards to context. For the global system-wide setting, semantic options are a hard topic, as different GUI apps have different requirements. But, luckily we are able to make use of the research done by various OS manufacturers for the design toolkits they use for the system apps. In this instance, Material 3 by Google and Fluent 2 by Microrsoft were used. The fluent methodology is simple, use neutral colours with varying brightness to create visual hierarchy (Microsoft, 2024).\n\nOriginally, this used to be the only inspiration which brought across a bunch of options named `NameX` where X was a number. But, not only was this confusing, most of these options were rarely used either. So instead, we took a look towards Google’s Material Design 3 (M3). The way M3 went about it’s colours was that, there were three accent variants - Primary, Secondary and Tertiary - and for each of these there were multiple variants, “On”, “Container”, “Variant” (Google, n.d.). But as each of these could be thought of as adding a new dimension, the colour options grew exponentially. This method was also too confusing, for an application that is targeted not for developers but end users. So, a middle ground was picked with the following options. They have meaning,\n\n1. Base: The most prevalent. Usually the background colour. Default: Desaturated “Primary”, then darkened or lightened based on the light\/dark mode property of the theme. The goal is to have a dark grey with a very slight tint of hue.\n\n2. Shade: Visually below the components using \"Base\". Usually used for sidebars. Default: Darken “Base” (HSV shift)\n\n3. Container: Visually above the components using \"Base\". Usually used for cards. Default: Lighten “Base” (HSV shift)\n\n4. Text: Foreground. Usually used for main text, and icons. Default: Base at opposite HSV value\n\n5. Subtle: Less important than \"Text\". Usually used for description texts. Default: Mix Base and Text by 75%\n\n6. Primary: The focus. Usually used for important buttons. Default: Rainbow Colours > Violet (Purple) The reason for this choice is that this is one of the few colours, left after Error\/Warning\/Success take away Red Green and Yellow\n\n7. Alternate: A contrasting accent. Used to create visual interest. Default: Rainbow Colours > Blue\n\n8. Error: Used to indicate errors. Default: Rainbow Colours > Red\n\n9. Warning: Used to indicate warnings. Default: Rainbow Colours > Yellow\n\n10. Success: Used to indicate success. Default: Rainbow Colours > Green\n\nb. Rainbow colours: \n\nColourful and vibrant colours, that includes the colours of the rainbow, minus indigo as the visual similarity to violet only creates confusion. Six colours in total. The colour for red is mandatory. By default, the rest are generated by hue-shifting red.\n\n2. Dark Mode: Whether the current theme is a dark theme or not. This option acts as a hint for certain apps that can make use of it (Such as the gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme option, or the AppsUseLightTheme windows registry).\n\n3. Typography: For a unified font configuration. This will have the 3 options of,\n\na. Serif: The font for documents\nb. Sans-Serif: The font for UI.\nc. Monospace: The font for code editors, and terminals.\n\nAll these options can derive from others (if the relationship isn’t recursive), and the application also allows the usage of “function calls” on these colours, allowing pseudo-programming. Some examples for these functions are desaturate, fade, mix, hue rotate, darken\/lighten, and so on. This allows the generation of dynamic and appealing colour palettes, even by only providing the system colour palette only.\n\nFinally, the user is given the option to generate the colour palette in various ways:\n\n1. Using an image (wallpaper). This will use an algorithm to determine harmonious colours from the image, like how Android’s Material You functions.\n\n2. Second is to generate an image using a textual prompt which is then passed onto an LLM.\n\n3. Third, the textual prompt can be used with a diffusion model, of which output will then in turn use the algorithm of the first option.\n\nSome sample textual prompts would be, “Tokyo at night”, “Desert oasis”, “Medieval Fantasy”.",

  "ProjectDescription": "In this modern world, most digital creators earn thousands of dollars by monetizing their content on digital platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Patreon. In the meantime, they are receiving a lot of sponsorships through social media. But there is one industry that doesn't have any platform to monetize its content and creations, and that industry doesn't receive any sponsorships because they have no platform to reach the people instead of meeting people physically. It is the performing art industry, they have only one platform to perform and reach the people and that platform is a stage. Instead of the stage, they have no platform. As for that issue, they are not financially stable. They are rich in talent but poor in technology. Performing art creators can't publish their content on YouTube because once they publish content, viewers\/ fans can watch it on YouTube without paying any cents. they can earn money from that but it is not the performing art. It's a digital creation; the uploaded videos on YouTube can be used\/watched by anyone. The other thing is most standup comedians can't publish their exclusive content to the public because they are the speakers who have lots of freedom to express their thoughts by laughing and making jokes. so they give highly exclusive content to deliver their thoughts to the people. And the other reason for creators to skip Netflix and Amazon Prime is the difficulty of getting featured on these two platforms. So They need a platform to store their content, monetize their content, seek sponsors, reach the audience, and grow their community in one place.",

The chatbot seamlessly executes the PHQ - 9 when opting for the depression-level assistance feature. \nWe are developing a set of nine questions, collaborating with a therapist, to assess depressive symptoms accurately. These questions will be intended to measure the frequency and effect of depression symptoms correctly. We hope to produce a questionnaire that represents the direct meaning of each item in the PHQ-9 and respects the complex nature of depression evaluation by working closely with the therapist.\n\nIt solicits additional relevant parameters from users, utilizing their responses to gauge their depression levels accurately. Armed with this insight, the chatbot then dispenses personalized suggestions to assist users in managing their emotional well-being. Furthermore, the chatbot ensures ongoing engagement by providing users weekly reports detailing improvements from the preceding week. Beyond depression-level assistance, the chatbot serves as an accessible resource for users seeking information about depression, facilitating a direct channel for addressing queries and dispelling uncertainties.\n",

The panels are arranged in a way that allows them to be seen horizontally, from yellowish green to dark green.\nThe standard version of International Rice Research Institute makes sure that the colours of the paddy leaves can be matched to matching colours in the LCC. Figure 3 depicts the standard version, which has four green colour variations, ranging from two for yellowish green to five for dark green.\nCurrently, the leaf colour comparison process with LCC is manual, which means farmers must visually match paddy leaves to LCC shades. As a result, accurate measurement is difficult for them. Farmers must also compare 6 to 10 leaves to the LCC level and find the average values. Incorrect visual reading of colours from an LCC by unaided eyes and fading\nof colour charts can frequently occur, resulting in the incorrect application of nitrogen fertilisers.\nThe proposed solution involves a user-friendly mobile application that allows the user to take images of the rice leaves through the application to generate a LCC number. Based on this LCC value, the system calculates the needed amount of nitrogen fertiliser and directly informs the user via the mobile app.",

Armed with this insight, the chatbot then dispenses personalized suggestions to assist users in managing their emotional well-being. Furthermore, the chatbot ensures ongoing engagement by providing users weekly reports detailing improvements from the preceding week. Beyond depression-level assistance, the chatbot serves as an accessible resource for users seeking information about depression, facilitating a direct channel for addressing queries and dispelling uncertainties.\n",

The primary functionality centers around triggering SOS messages with location details to preset emergency contact. This is achieved by leveraging the device's location services to obtain the user's current location and then sending SMS messages containing GPS information. Additionally, the Guardia employs biometric authentication, requiring authorized user verification, typically through fingerprint recognition, to cancel SOS requests. To ensure continuous assistance during emergencies, a countdown timer initiates periodic SOS messages at 5 minutes intervals until canceled. The implementation adheres to Android's permission model, dynamically requesting permissions for SMS sending and location access as needed. The robust error handling mechanisms and user feedback, such as “toast” messages, enhance the overall usability of the application.

  "ProjectDescription": "This project consists of many benefits that can affect Sri Lanka in many positive ways. Carrying out this project RoamCeylon will help Sri Lanka attract more foreign nomads, where there will be people from overseas countries visiting Sri Lanka to continue working remotely and earning passive income. Sri Lanka, benefiting from a low cost of living, will help the Nomads to settle down fairly easily due to the weaker currency in Sri Lanka. For example, If a Nomad from USA visits and wants to settle in Sri Lanka for a while to continue his\/her remote job, it will allow the person to do much more with the passive income the Nomad receives, due to Sri Lanka’s cost of living being very low compared to developed nations like USA and the UK. This will allow the Nomad to spend money more freely and live with a higher standard of living with the same income in Sri Lanka. A major feature of RoamCeylon that sets it apart from its competitors is the utilization of NLP to provide recommendations, where the user can receive personalized feedback after submitting a paragraph describing the user’s preferences for their ideal location to stay in Sri Lanka.\n",

  "ProjectDescription": "The proposed solution is to develop a Software that offers localized, real-time agricultural advice to rural government advisors in Sri Lanka. The Software will be a comprehensive tool designed to empower rural advisors with the knowledge and resources necessary to provide better support and guidance to farmers.\nKey Features\nThe Software will offer the following key features:\nWeather Forecast: This feature will provide up-to-date weather forecasts and climate information specific to the user's region. Farmers will receive real-time weather updates to assist them in making informed decisions regarding planting and harvesting.\nCrop Guidance: The Software will offer comprehensive crop guidance tailored to the farmer's specific region. It will recommend suitable crops based on local soil conditions and provide planting schedules and best practices for crop management.\nPest and Disease Alerts: Farmers will receive alerts and information about common pests and diseases affecting crops in their area. The Software will also offer recommended treatment options to help mitigate these issues.\nMarket Price Information: Real-time market prices for various crops in nearby markets will be displayed, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions on when and where to sell their produce.\nFarming Techniques: The Software will share best practices for sustainable and efficient farming techniques. Topics may include irrigation, fertilization, and pest control methods, with easy-to-understand guides and video tutorials.\nAccess to Resources: Links to local resources, such as agricultural extension services, seed suppliers, and information on agricultural loans, will be provided to support farmers in their agricultural endeavors.\nLocal Community Forum: This feature will serve as a space for local farmers to connect, share experiences, and seek advice from one another. Moderation will ensure a respectful and helpful community.\nAdditional Features\nThe following additional features are also being considered:\nAI-powered crop disease and pest detection: This feature would allow farmers to upload photos of their crops to the Software and receive real-time feedback on potential crop diseases and pests. This would allow farmers to identify and address problems early on, before they cause significant damage to their crops.\nWeather-based farming activity prediction: This feature would use weather data to predict the best times for farmers to perform various farming activities, such as planting, harvesting, and applying pesticides. This would help farmers to make better decisions about their farming practices and improve their overall efficiency.\nOffline Capability\nThe Software will also be designed with offline capability in mind, so that farmers can access its features even when they do not have internet access. This is especially important for farmers in rural areas, where internet access may be unreliable or expensive.\n",

  "ProjectDescription": "In our day-to-day lives, we constantly see advertisements and posts on social media for finding blood types for urgent needs. Due to not being able to find these blood types in due time, many people face various difficulties and sometimes unfortunately even lose their lives.\n\nThe proposed solution is to develop a platform for blood donation. The primary objective is to establish direct communication between donors and patients requesting blood. The envisioned blood donation platform incorporates paradigmatic differences from existing conventional systems.\n\nMost existing online platforms are only focused on blood donation. In system team members bridge the gap by incorporating blood donation. The existing methods frequently rely on the databases of blood banks. By doing away with this reliance, the platform  provides a more direct line of communication between donors and patients.\n\nMost existing systems rely on centralized databases to store donor and patient information. On the other hand, the suggested system utilizes DApp technology (Web3) and blockchain for decentralized storage of donation donor and patient data. This is an innovative method that improves security, transparency, and trust in the donation procedure. The blockchain provides a transparent and immutable ledger for donors and patients which allows them to track their donations. This feature helps to build trust among the users as they can check the history of donations and transactions that are securely recorded on the blockchain.\n\nTogether, these innovations distinguish the proposed solution from other platforms, addressing important shortcomings and providing a more sophisticated, inclusive, and solution for blood donation.",

Driving under such conditions can result in momentary lapse in consciousness leading to a loss of control over the vehicle and significantly increasing the risk of road accidents.\n\nOver the years, the rate of road accidents attributed to driver drowsiness or fatigue poses a significant threat to road safety across the world. This not only endangers the drowsy driver but also puts other individuals sharing the road at serious risk. A single moment of inattention can have a far reaching and devastating effect on multiple lives.\n\nIn response to this issue, the team has developed an innovative solution aimed at either completely preventing or significantly reducing accidents caused by driver fatigue by continuously tracking the drivers facial behavior looking for signs of drowsiness and if detected, a warning alarm will sound alerting the driver to stay awake while driving.",
